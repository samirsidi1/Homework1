## M-Pesa: Giving Millions Access to Banking in Africa

![](assets/README-1f82024a.png)

## Overview and Origin
M-Pesa is a branchless payment system founded in 2007 through a public-private partnership between Vodafone and Kenya’s Safaricom.  The partnership was initially funded by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) to develop a payment system using encrypted text messages for the millions of unbanked people across the developing world.  The system functions by depositing money, or pesa in Swahili, to a user’s sim card.  Payments are then transferred using secure text message.  The basic M-Pesa system employs only built-in features on all standard cell phones and operates with minimal connectivity.


## Business Activities:

Today, M-Pesa has over 30 million users and processes over 6 billion transactions a year, which amounts to $3 billion a month.  The Kenyan Central Bank estimates that over 48% of Kenya’s GDP is processed over M Pesa.  According to a 2018 Financing and Development report from the United Nations, “In Kenya, the expansion of mobile money lifted two per cent of households in the country above the poverty line.”


## Landscape:

M-Pesa’s ability to build an entire banking infrastructure simply using a sim card and messaging was on display in Afghanistan.  In 2003, Roshan Telecom received a grant from Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development to build a national cellular phone network in Afghanistan.  By 2008, more than 60% of the country was connected and had access to cellular phones.  However, Afghanistan still lacked a functioning financial system.  Enter M-Pesa.  Merchants and consumers that were relying on gold/silver transactions and the barter system, were able to purchase goods and services using M-Pesa.  The program was so successful that the Afghani government started paying civil servants using M-Pesa.  Today, Afghanistan has over 15.5 million mobile phone users and 10 million M-Pesa accounts.

According to a 2008 World Bank report, M-Money Channel Distribution Case – Afghanistan,” M-Paisa is a proven system that provides access to financial services for under-served people in a post conflict country where cities are facing a demographic explosion, where distances are vast, the environment is harsh and transportation remains insecure. M-Paisa will provide much needed services to a range of people across the nation with reduced costs for both banks and customers, using a fast, easy, and secure wireless technology.”

## Recommendations

#### Antitrust Concerns

M-Pesa is not without its problems.  According to a 2013 report from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation, consolidation or a lack of competition, as is the case in Kenya, will inevitably lead to higher transactions fees. “The structure of competition in the market also has an important impact on a payment system’s reach to poor consumers. Limited competition can keep prices for consumers overly high.”  

To survive antitrust scrutiny, M-Pesa must allow third-party providers access to its vast infrastructure. This solution (third-party access to interface) prevented the breakup of Microsoft in 2001.  

M-Pesa could also stratify fees based on socio-economic conditions (e.g. wave fees for women owned businesses).  

#### Money Laundering Concerns

In Afghanistan, there is evidence that M-Pesa is used to facilitate the sale of opium.  According to United Nations, “there is an important connection between drugs and money transfer systems in Afghanistan.”  The UN estimates that “about 60% of the funds are drug related and 80-90% of the hawala dealers in Kandahar and Helmand are involved in money transfers related to narcotics.”
Roshan and Vodafone are also cognizant that M-Pesa is being used to finance terrorism and launder money.  According to the World Bank, “Roshan is extremely concerned about the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing through M-Paisa and has implemented a number of policies and procedures to guard against these risks.”

M-Pesa’s recent foray into Romania, Albania, and India was also met with regulatory scrutiny.  As of 2018, Vodafone shuttered all M-Pesa operations outside on Africa.  

To re-enter these markets and ensure compliance in existing markets, M- Pesa will have to integrate AML technology into their ecosystem. There are cost effective ad-ons offered by a variety of companies, including Microsoft Azure that enables users to easily program machine learning models.

### Business Diversification

#### Healthcare - Medical Teleconferencing

M-Pesa (Vodafone) could be at the forefront of launching mobile teldoc services.  Africa has a predominantly rural population with limited access to healthcare.  However, the majority of the continent has access to mobile technology.  M-Pesa can leverage their massive customer base by introducing medical teleconferencing (free of charge at the outset) and then integrating in-app purchases.
